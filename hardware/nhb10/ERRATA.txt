Mext Hope Badge 1.0 Errata
by Travis Goodspeed

ERRATUM 1.

Pin 80 of U2 is AVcc.  It should not be run to ground.  Lift the pin
to correct.

ERRATUM 2.

The battery is located too close to the JTAG port.  Fixed in NHB11 by
moving it further North.

ERRATUM 3.

The programmers shipped to Shanghai with firmware that is not
compatible with the new MSP430 chips.  New firmware needs to be
flashed, and a new client needs to be used.

ERRATUM 4.

The TEST pin of the FTDI should be tied to GND.  Leaving it floating
makes the device non-functional unless you are lucky enough to have a
solder bridge.
