<h1>Next Hope Badge USB Modification</h1>

<p>by Travis Goodspeed &lt;travis at tnbelt.com&gt;,<br />
for use with or without a badge hacking kit distributed by Mitch Altman.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The following instructions are for adding USB support to a Next
Hope conference badge, model numbers of which are NHB12 and NHB12B.
For further details see my article entitled
<a href="http://travisgoodspeed.blogspot.com/2010/06/hacking-next-hope-badge.html">Hacking
the Next Hope Badge</a>.</p>

<p>While these instructions are not terribly complicated, the kit is
not intended for a first-time solderer.  If you have never soldered
before, then build a TV-B-Gone as practice before having someone help
you assemble this kit.</p>

<h2>Modification</h2>

<p>First, be sure that you have both a mini USB connector and an
FT232RL chip, as pictured below.  This are included in Mitch's
kit.</p>

<p>Modify your badge by the following steps:</p>
<ul>

<li>(Optional) Use a soldering iron to remove first one side, then the
other, of the battery clip.  If leaving the battery in place, be sure not to
have both a battery and USB power at the same time.</li>

<li>Use a Dremel tool or fine cutters to remove the two plastic nubs
from the the Mini USB plug.  The badges as manufactured lack holes for the
nubs, so it is necessary to remove them for mechanical compatibility.</li>

<li>Fit the Mini USB connector to the board as shown in Appendix A.
It should fit flush with the board, fitting securely after soldering.
Solder a single of the pins first, then a second to ensure proper
positioning.  The side plugs should be soldered last, with plenty of extra
solder for mechanical stability.</li>

<li><b>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES</b> should the board be held by its USB
connector.  If twisted as a level, the connector will come off, and it
will not be fun to repair the board.</p>

<li>Once the USB connector is properly in place, fit the FTDI chip as
shown in Appendix A.  The circle on the chip, which indicates Pin 1,
should be next to the "U3" text.  First, tack a single corner pin of
the chip.  Once this is done and the chip is still positioned
properly, tack a pin on the opposite corner with as little solder as
possible.  Finally, after verifying that those pins are properly
positioned, solder the remaining pins.  If any bridge, remove the
excess solder with a coper soldering wick.</li>

<li>Having these parts connected, plug the badge into your computer
using the included USB A to Mini B cable.  You should then see a new
USB device enumeration.  If anything gets hot, immediately unplug the
badge and check your soldering.</li>

</ul>
